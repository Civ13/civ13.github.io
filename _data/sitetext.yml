      Civ13 is a game based on Space Station 13 code, which features several epochs 
      of human history. (hence the name). It features both Roleplay-oriented and Team-Deathmatch 
      modes, with the main one being Nomads, in which you need to bring your civilization 
      from the Stone Age to the Modern Age.

      RP gamemodes, especially the Nomads maps, are focused on building and 
      interacting with other players.

      Nomads mode is a subtype of the Civilization 13 mode. In Nomads Mode, 
      everyone spawns without any pre-determined factions, with only a knife and basic clothing.
      You can stay factionless (a nomad), create your own or be invited to one. 
      However, research points can only be collected if you have a faction.

      Combat gamemodes have different maps from prehistory to modern times.

      Welcome! This is an attempt at remaking Civ13, a BYOND game, using TypeScript and Node.js.
      This is loosely forked from the Bluespess engine, 
      a JavaScript remake of the /tg/station codebase of SS13, also a BYOND game.
