Nomads mode is a subtype of the Civilization 13 mode. In Nomads Mode, everyone spawns without any pre-determined factions, with only a knife and basic clothing.
You can stay factionless (a nomad), create your own or be invited to one. However, research points can only be collected if you have a faction.
